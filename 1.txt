In a rainforest that glowed with magic, lived a little boy named Sam. He loved his animal friends, but he saw they were sad. A wide, rushing river kept them from the sweetest, juiciest berries on the other side.


"I will build you a bridge!" Sam declared one evening, as a thousand bioluminescent butterflies began to glow. A little monkey chattered doubtfully from a branch above. The river was very, very wide.


The next day, Sam tried to push a big log. It wouldn't budge. He tried to pull a long vine. It was too heavy. He sat down and sighed. "The river is too big, and I am too small," he whispered.


Just then, a wise old owl with feathers like the twilight sky landed softly beside him. "The tallest tree in this forest started as a tiny seed," the owl hooted gently. "Your dream is a seed, little one. All it needs is courage to grow."


Sam felt a spark of courage in his heart. He found a strong, fallen branch, much smaller than the log. He dragged it to the river's edge with all his might. It wasn't much, but it was a start!


The little monkey, seeing Sam's hard work, swung down from the trees. He chattered excitedly and started gathering strong, twisty vines, dropping them in a pile for Sam.



Soon, a family of capybaras came to help, pushing a fallen log with their noses. Squirrels scurried, tying knots with the vines, their quick paws a blur. Everyone was working together!


They worked and worked until the sky was full of stars. At last, the bridge was finished! It stretched from one side of the river to the other, a little wobbly, but strong and brave, just like Sam.



A tiny firefly mouse was the first to try it. He took a brave little step, and then another. The bioluminescent butterflies swirled around him, lighting up the path like a magical runway.



Then all the animals cheered! They scampered across the bridge, their bellies soon full of sweet berries. Sam watched them, his heart full of joy. He had learned that with a little courage and a lot of help, even the biggest dreams can come true.
