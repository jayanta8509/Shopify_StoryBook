    two_page_story = f"\"I will build you a bridge!\" {name} declared one evening, as a thousand bioluminescent butterflies began to glow. A little monkey chattered doubtfully from a branch above. The river was very, very wide."
    three_page_story = f"The next day, {name} tried to push a big log. It wouldn't budge. {name} tried to pull a long vine. It was too heavy. He sat down and sighed. \"The river is too big, and I am too small,\" {name} whispered."
    four_page_story = f"Just then, a wise old owl with feathers like the twilight sky landed softly beside him. \"The tallest tree in this forest started as a tiny seed,\" the owl hooted gently. \"Your dream is a seed, little one. All it needs is courage to grow.\""
    five_page_story = f"{name} felt a spark of courage in his heart. {name} found a strong, fallen branch, much smaller than the log. {name} dragged it to the river's edge with all his might. It wasn't much, but it was a start!"

    eight_page_story = f"They worked and worked until the sky was full of stars. At last, the bridge was finished! It stretched from one side of the river to the other, a little wobbly, but strong and brave, just like {name}."
    nine_page_story = f"A tiny firefly mouse was the first to try it. {name} took a brave little step, and then another. The bioluminescent butterflies swirled around him, lighting up the path like a magical runway."
    ten_page_story = f"Then all the animals cheered! They scampered across the bridge, their bellies soon full of sweet berries. {name} watched them, his heart full of joy. {name} had learned that with a little courage and a lot of help, even the biggest dreams can come true."
